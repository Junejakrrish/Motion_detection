I created a motion detection project using Python and OpenCV. For video capture, frame processing, and motion detection, I utilized the OpenCV library. When continuous motion is detected for a specified duration, a beep alarm is triggered. This project involves camera initialization, frame processing, motion detection, alarm triggering, and user control through key inputs.
